# Tranzit-Maxis-EE-Solo-Tweak
Direct copy of CCDeroga's Tranzit Maxis Solo EE mod, but with a wider tolerance for the Avogadro's position when EMPed. I made this tweak because I was running into issues where the Avogadro was clearly under the tower, the turbine was powered, and EMPing the Avogadro did not complete the step. It may be an issue with the defined volume for the step, or I may just be bad at the game. Regardless this tweak has fixed the issue for me. 

Place the file in the ".\AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\zm_transit" folder. Create any missing folders if necessary.

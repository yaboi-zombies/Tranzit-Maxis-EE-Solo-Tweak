# Tranzit-Maxis-EE-Solo-Tweak
Direct copy of CCDeroga's Tranzit Maxis Solo EE mod, but with a wider tolerance for the Avogadro's position when EMPed. I made this tweak because I was running into issues where the Avogadro was clearly under the tower, the turbine was powered, and EMPing the Avogadro did not complete the step.
